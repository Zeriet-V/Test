However, the design creates an optical illusion that can make it appear as though it's moving or vibrating when you look at it. This effect is created by the specific arrangement and contrast of the patterns and colors in the image. Optical illusions like this one can play tricks on our eyes and brain, making us perceive motion even when there isn't any."
